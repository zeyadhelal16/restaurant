This Restaurant Website project is a multi-page web application designed to present a complete digital presence for a restaurant. The website includes a Home page that introduces the restaurant and its identity, a Menu page showcasing available dishes, a Gallery page displaying photos of the restaurant, and a Reservation page where customers can book a table.

The project focuses on delivering a clean layout, smooth navigation, and a user-friendly experience. Each page is structured to provide clear information while maintaining a consistent design style across the entire website.

The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing responsive design, organized page structure, and interactive elements such as form validation for table reservations.

This project demonstrates front-end development skills, including multi-page website structure, UI design consistency, user interaction handling, and creating a realistic business-oriented web solution.
