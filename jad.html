              conducts heat much more efficiently than air, foods that are
              confited in it, like these chicken thighs, come out incredibly
              moist and infused with the oil’s flavor.

            <h3>Berries and Buttermilk Puddings</h3>
            <p>
              Tangy buttermilk isn't just for biscuits and waffles. It makes a
              wonderful base for these delicate individual puddings.

            <h3>Pineapple Galette</h3>
            <p>
              Fresh pineapple conjures up images of sunshine, so what better way
              to cheer up a winter day than with a galette made with golden
              yellow wedges layered over buttery pastry? Today's pineapples tend
              to be quite sweet, so just a hint of cinnamon and sugar is all
              you'll need to bring out their bright flavor.

            <p>
              A rich fig filling is studded with walnuts and imbued with citrusy
              notes of orange, then packaged between a crust and a lattice top,
              both made from the cookie-like pastry dough known as pasta frolla
              in Italy. If you love Fig Newtons, you'll love this dessert.

              Lion’s head meatballs are traditionally stewed or steamed in a

              What’s better than a griddled burger with the crispiest exterior?
              One that comes sandwiched between a vibrant tomatillo salsa and
              topped with a runny fried egg.

              Made from canned salmon—plus a few pantry staples you likely keep
              in stock—and slicked with tangy red-pepper mayo, this burger is
              easy to toss together on the fly.

            <p>
              I love burgers that ooze cheese when you bite into them, but
              turkey burgers typically fall apart when you make them with a
              chunk of cheese in the center. Instead of working against the
              ingredients, I work with them.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Lamb burgers are a great way to switch up burger night at home.
              Change is good, y’all! Lamb has more of an earthy, gamey flavor
              than beef, and it’s completely delicious paired with creamy goat
              cheese and deeply caramelized.
